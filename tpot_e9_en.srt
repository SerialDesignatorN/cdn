He’s VERY protective of it, 
so please be as gentle as--

166
00:08:57,021 --> 00:08:57,680
[rustling]

167
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,792
GO, GO, GO!

168
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,167
Pfffeeee--YEW! Good idea, Yellow Face!

169
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:06,640
The collection has grown so SO large 
with donations from my factory,  

170
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,292
should take AGES for those guys to break in!

171
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,857
STEAK TIIIIME!

172
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:13,167
NOM. MmmMH MHMHM! DE-LISH!

173
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:23,640
You guys…SO heavy…NO…YOU DON’T THINK…UNDEAD 
NON-EXISTY IS PULLING US DOWN, DO YOU?

174
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,560
It’s CLEARLY Yoyleball down there, so 
GET HIM OFF before we all die, dingaling!

175
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,440
She’s…augh--RIGHT SNOWBALL! You 
might need to jump off, I’m sorry!

176
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,800
WHAT?! Those freak WIMPS are RIGHT BEHIND US!

177
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,240
You’re METAL!

178
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,800
Yeah they…ughh…probably can’t even bite you!

179
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,300
FINE!

180
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,102
[sigh] Thank you, Snowball! Muuuuuch better!

181
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:48,755
Oh, phew! See, I knew they couldn’t do anythi--

182
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,480
SNOWBALL! I’M SO SORRY!

183
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,750
GO, BELL! GO, GO, GO!

184
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:06,792
Hmm, looks like a crowd are 
chasing Bell over there…

185
00:10:09,037 --> 00:10:13,084
GAH! THEY’RE COMING THIS WAY! BLACK 
HOLE, YOU MUST STOP THEM! NOW!

186
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:14,800
Black Hole: As in--

187
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,588
SUCK THEM UP!!!

188
00:10:15,588 --> 00:10:19,600
Black Hole: But they’re not DEAD, 
they’re…UNDEAD. I…uh, I don’t think I can…

189
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:28,800
Phew, you can’t argue now, huh Buddy? Well, 
I have a solution! We simply MOVE Tree!

190
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,709
That’s ludicrous, have you SEEN how huge he is 
right now? How are we possibly going to do that?

191
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:34,975
[splash]

192
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:41,047
Marker: Do you have a BETTER 
IDEA?! Quick, FANNY! DIG, DIG, DIG!

193
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:41,875
[splash]

194
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,042
Look, the reception was bad, the--the challenge 
can’t POSSIBLY be to kill each-other, right?

195
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:50,595
[electricity crackling]

196
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,895
Guys? HELLO?!

197
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,542
We can talk about this! We 
can figure something out…

198
00:10:58,542 --> 00:10:59,175
[bang]

199
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:00,750
HELLO? What was that?

200
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,979
I saw that…anyone there?

201
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:06,880
Gelatin [recording]: WELCOME TO 
GELATIN’S STAKEHOUSE! If you're  

202
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,617
looking for my house MADE of 
steak, it's across the street.

203
00:11:09,828 --> 00:11:11,459
Pst…over here, buddy.

204
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,440
The stress of all of this was JUST 
TOO MUCH for Little ol’ Nickely-loo!

205
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,600
I figure we can just SLEEP THROUGH IT!

206
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,360
I found this bed in the trash, and 
I’m all snug up with this blanket!

207
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,680
And now all I need to make 
this complete would be…A-HAH!

208
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,920
I found a nice little pillow! Oh 
OH so COMFY! Yay, this is so comf--

209
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,042
WAIT--PILLOW?!

210
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:34,710
Nickel: aUUUGg…

211
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:37,000
One down! Hello, Book!

212
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I could really use some of 
your glue for some nice armor!

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,142
PILLOW! NO! PILLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!

214
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,334
Run…Run RUN RUN RUN RUN!

215
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,354
[scream]

216
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,778
OOW! What happened to--

217
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,255
--OH MY FENCE!

218
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,920
WE’RE STUCK! PEEPS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS!

219
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,040
TWO! I’M COMING!

220
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,079
Split up, SPLIT UP! TB, we need the lab!

221
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,780
WE NEED TO THINK OF SOMETHING FAST!

222
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,167
TV: We’ll try to lead the undead elsewhere!

223
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,012
WHOOPS! I meant to hit TD, hahaha!

224
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:17,292
TV: If we stack up, we can access the vents 
up there, for escape! You two, get on my head!

225
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,134
TV: WARNING! WARNING! THEY ARE COMING!
Eraser: Hurry, TD! We gotta jump!

226
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,093
Alrighty, TV, grab my legs--

227
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:26,000
[fallen soldier sirens]
TV: Good luck, my friends. May we meet again.

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,889
Wha--NO--TV, we can--

229
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,600
NOO! Teardrop, help me up, please!

230
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,080
Teardrop? TEAARRDROP?! DON’T DO THIS!

231
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:35,017
CURSE YOU TEARDRO--

232
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,180
---Oh?

233
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,653
Thank you, TD. We got this--

234
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:40,794
[munch]
Auug---ohh…

235
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,520
YOU GUYS GOTTA HURRY! THEY’RE ON THEIR WAY!

236
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,720
Maybe--uh, I can find some protection?

237
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,637
Where are they…

238
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,375
Woah! So many goodies! But what are they after?

239
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,709
BLACK HOLE SILLY! Don’t suck US up, hehe!

240
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,575
OH! Of course not! But--guys! I need 
this stash! I need to protect Tree!

241
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,880
WAIT--if you take the whole 
collection, we are all going to DIE!

242
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,960
BAH--but if I DON’T take them,  

243
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,560
TREE is going to DIE! Why are they so 
adamantly coming to you guys, anyway?

244
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,674
Who knows, but these steaks are getting co-OLD! 
So to you, little cold steak, I say: GOODBYE!

245
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,711
USE THOSE STEAKS TO DEFLECT! I’m 
taking this stash to save Tree!

246
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,280
Where are they CHASING US?

247
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,200
Maybe they’d STOP and GIVE 
UP if you’d just GO HIGHER!

248
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,959
I could go higher if you all GOT OFF!

249
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,408
WOAH, SICK! This team’s 
lame, I’m joining those guys!

250
00:13:47,213 --> 00:13:48,104
[biting]

251
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,426
Not working, STUPID! But it doesn’t 
matter, I like you guys, for now!

252
00:13:53,873 --> 00:13:58,040
ARGH! I TOLD YOU, BELL! She’s a 
COMPLETE LIABILITY, RIGHT NOW!

253
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,167
He’s getting bigger! Just fly, FLY!

254
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,280
The lava combined with the Barf 
seems to have caused Barf Bag’s  

255
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,160
insides to rot! This mutation seems 
to spread when she bites people…

256
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,840
So if we can undo the rotting…maybe 
by powering the bodies up somehow,  

257
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,748
maybe we can get Barf Bag and 
everyone else back to normal!

258
00:14:18,748 --> 00:14:22,875
Argh…if only we knew what caused Barf 
Bag to get so strong last episode…

259
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,959
Two?

260
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,875
Two [whispering]: Over here.

261
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,292
Two? Are you okay?

262
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:35,542
Two [whispering]: In here. Come on.

263
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,750
Uh, Two, I’m…a little freaked out.

264
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,959
Two [whispering]: Inside.

265
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:49,128
[breathing heavily] Two…I--I know 
you’re…not you right now but…

266
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:51,125
Two [whispering]: C’mon.

267
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:53,750
[breathes out] Two…

268
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,917
You there?

269
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,080
TWO?

270
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,167
Gaty: Is that--are you okay?

271
00:15:01,925 --> 00:15:03,542
[whispering] Two--are you okay?

272
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:06,084
Gaty: WAIT, TWO, DON’T--

273
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,520
Hey guys, what should we do when 
we start running low on steaks?

274
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,520
I don’t know, maybe just yell 
“warning” or something to let us know--

275
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,459
WARNING, WARNING, WARNING! We 
have ONE steaky left, team!

276
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,703
I need a BIG stash, guys! Keep throwing!

277
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:29,917
[breathing in and out quickly]
We’re doomed…they’re coming!

278
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:34,440
We have one steak left…who is brave 
enough to head off with it and save us?

279
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,250
Not me!

280
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,792
I WANT REVENGE!

281
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:41,792
oOF!

282
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,507
[gasping for air] ARE YOU GUYS OKAY?!

283
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,320
Price-Tag: Hello?

284
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,120
Price-Tag? Is that you?

285
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,560
What the sales catalogue are 
you guys doing down there?

286
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,000
The sewers led us here! Where are you right now?

287
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,880
Price-Tag: I’m hiding in 
the back of the steakhouse,  

288
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,120
did you guys know this used to be a shadeshouse?

289
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,280
Those shades are handy! Some 
change colours and stuff,  

290
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,467
should be good for looking for those 
dead guys and keeping everyone alive!

291
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,660
DONUT?!

292
00:16:22,618 --> 00:16:25,360
Wait…”keeping everyone alive”...

293
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,520
Guys! The challenge is to stay 
ALIVE…we don’t have to hurt each-other!

294
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,542
GUYS! …ARGH, FINE! “Night 
vision”, eh? Should be handy…

295
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:39,746
Dum dee dum, do, do, do…

296
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:41,957
PILLOW! We need to STAY ALIVE! DON’T DO THIS!

297
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,292
STOOOOP!

298
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,509
OoooooOO!

299
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,959
Aw, fluff.

300
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:49,917
[slowly breathing heavily]

301
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:53,520
Bomby? Nickel? Any of you safe? Pillow’s dead…

302
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,632
Bomby: Good work, Price-Tag! Pillow 
is a tough foe, good job on--

303
00:16:56,632 --> 00:16:58,482
[rip]

304
00:16:58,753 --> 00:17:01,947
They only grazed me. And now, Bomby, there’s you.

305
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:03,167
Bomby: And now there’s you.

306
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:06,542
OMIGOSHOMIGOSHOMIGOSHOMIGOSH--

307
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,292
GETTING THERE! We need more time, Black Hole!

308
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,417
Check THIS out!

309
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,327
STAY BACK!

310
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,847
Haha, look, it’s working!

311
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:18,375
[splash]

312
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,043
NO!

313
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,818
[splash]

314
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,334
They’re CLIMBING! Dig, Marker! Dig!

315
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:33,200
NO! I can’t believe this is our end, AND they 
got Icy! Waaaaah, I wish we could’ve saved Icy!

316
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,617
Waaaah, I wish I could’ve 
sold more from my factory!

317
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,639
I mean, uh…what Bottle said!

318
00:17:51,327 --> 00:17:54,280
GAH! None of the gadgets in 
this STUPID factory work!

319
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,539
I can’t believe there’s something that
the two of us can’t figure out!

320
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:58,584
I know.

321
00:17:58,882 --> 00:17:59,382
GAH!

322
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,977
This is all YOUR FAULT Barf Bag!

323
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,683
[sharp inhale]

324
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:09,120
Uh…hey guys…where am I?

325
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,160
BARF BAG? YOU’RE BACK TO NORMAL?

326
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,720
OH MY GOSH…TD! IT WAS YOU! Your effects on Barf 
Bag’s lava barf somehow made it less degenerative…

327
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,200
But unlike Barf Bag, most of 
the undead victims don’t have  

328
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,120
external innards. We need to find 
another way to cure everyone else!

329
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,400
They’re going to have to ingest the barf 
somehow…Barf Bag, you are the only way we  

330
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,469
can save everyone. We’re gonna have 
to take your innards out once again.

331
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:35,315
Uh, I still don’t know what’s happening. But 
if it helps everyone else, let’s do it lol.

332
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,960
There’s not…there’s not enough in here, we need 
more liquid! Teardrop, can you hop back in?

333
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,042
But…if she gets absorbed…she’ll die!

334
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,561
And get…eliminated…oh…

335
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,895
Thank you, TD! Your sacrifice won’t be in vain!

336
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,125
Barf Bag and Teardrop, you are 
HEROES! Hurry TB, let’s feed this to--

337
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:02,370
AHHHH!

338
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,960
BELL, WE GOTTA HIDE SOMEWHERE!

339
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,417
I’ll take us back to the grasslands--maybe 
they’ve sorted something out, already!

340
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,120
THEY’RE GONE! WE’RE SAFE!

341
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,280
WATER! WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE NOW!

342
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,566
There’s a crack forming above! Let’s escape!

343
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,420
I think we’re doomed!

344
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,667
This stash is HUGE, it’s gonna take 
forever to climb over! Have faith!

345
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,240
GUYS?! Any updates? Have 
you solved these guys yet?

346
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,164
No we--wait--WHAT IS THAT?

347
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,275
WATCH OUT!!!!

348
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,959
GO GO GO!

349
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:39,750
Pin: NEEDLE! NO!

350
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,360
TWO, NOO!!!

351
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,160
Hi. I’m not Two though.

352
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,040
W--Gaty, you’re here too? Where are we?

353
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,800
It appears Two sent us to the 
elimination space instead of  

354
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,750
killing us like all of those other undead guys.

355
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,750
[sigh of relief] Even in 
zombie form, Two’s pretty cool.

356
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,009
So…can I rejoin?

357
00:19:59,009 --> 00:19:59,599
NO!

358
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:03,584
[glass shattering]

359
00:20:05,844 --> 00:20:09,878
Huh? A drink for my final moments? Bottoms up!

360
00:20:09,878 --> 00:20:10,584
GLUG GLUG!

361
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,959
BLERGH! Reminds me of 
ROCKY-OL-BUDDY! Have this, Conch-man!

362
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,334
W--oh! Hey guys!

363
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,917
WOAH! That made him BACK TO NORMAL! IT WORKS!

364
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:30,760
Have YOU ever needed to get this vial to the OTHER 
DEAD GUYS? Then why not COOK IT into some STEAKS?

365
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,920
Good idea! But how do we get 
in? We’re still locked out!

366
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
Hello Bomby!

367
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,880
Should we do this…the easy way?

368
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,250
Or the other easy way?

369
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,760
The even easier way! I’m gonna 
take YOU down on my terms.

370
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,316
Huh?

371
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,084
Oh no, I just lit my fuse.

372
00:20:46,084 --> 00:20:46,999
Wait--Don’t--

373
00:20:46,999 --> 00:20:48,009
[explosion]

374
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,959
WHAT? FIRE? FIREE?!!?

375
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,160
OUCH! BLACK HOLE, STOP THAT 
SNOWBALL! IT NEARLY KILLED ME!

376
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,400
YOU GOT IT!

377
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,780
GUYS! Get in the kitchen!

378
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,370
HHMMM! Have YOU ever wanted 
to solve an apocalypse?

379
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,750
I think we’re safe for now, no more pulling, Tree!

380
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,834
Luckily we caused nooooo death 
whatsoever! And no danger, too! Hahaha!

381
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,460
No--OPEN UP AGAIN! WHY IS IT CLOSED?!

382
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,625
Ugh, my roots are getting itchy.

383
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:36,209
Probably because of all of 
our digging. Sorry, Tree.

384
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:38,044
OPEN! OPEN!

385
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,209
I can’t do it…

386
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:51,520
COINY--I’m so sorry you got out…I don’t 
even know if I can figure this out alone--

387
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,639
GARRGH!

388
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,779
NO--NEEDLE WAS RIGHT. Right now, you’re 
not you. But I can figure this out!

389
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:02,042
[banging]

390
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:06,912
GOSH! I DID IT! I did it.

391
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,278
Oh, hey Pi--uh…WAH? Did you KILL COINY?

392
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:14,750
Uh…it’s not what it looks like?

393
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,667
[gulp] H--huh? What happened?

394
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:30,200
[licking noises] MhmHHMMM! 
YAY! You guys--you did it!

395
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,900
I don’t know what’s with all this snow, but the 
steakhouse looks nice! Let’s snap you all back!

396
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:34,400
[snaps fingers]

397
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,920
PIN! You also survived!

398
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:43,120
I’m so happy to see you, Gaty! That was 
honestly rough, today. Seeing Coiny like that.

399
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,520
Yeah. I saw the same thing in Two. 
But…I saw a good side of them,  

400
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,400
as well. Even when they were…like that.

401
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,160
Two could’ve killed us but…they didn’t. 
It’s just nice to hold onto that.

402
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,800
I really didn’t think I could 
play this game without Coiny,  

403
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,720
but…he kinda…pushed me towards 
fighting for myself down there.

404
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Yeah…I think that’s a good way 
to look at it. Thanks Gaty.

405
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,360
Pen bit me. Got a good bite 
too! I screamed and it hurt.

406
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,600
We were, uh…talking about the good qualities 
we saw in our friends, even when zombified.

407
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,000
Me too, haha. Classic Pen. 
Always biting something.

408
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:25,680
Golf Ball: I thought you KILLED us, 
Two! But we just went where Pie was!

409
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,520
Oh, I sent you guys THERE? Whoops…you weren’t 
meant to go there, yet. Oh well! Glad you’re safe!

410
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,680
But let’s see how many members you all have left!

411
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,284
Up first, TEARDROP!

412
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,334
Wait…Teardrop…died.

413
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:37,209
[gasp]

414
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:42,611
Teardrop…I’m sorry to say that you are eliminated.

415
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,720
Hey, TD--I know we’ve had our ups and downs  

416
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,560
but…I really appreciate you 
trying to save me back there.

417
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,440
And honestly, do you even NEED to 
win the power of two? Look at all  

418
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,560
the amazing things you’ve pulled off this season.

419
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,491
You played a great game, TD. 
And the best man won, hahaha.

420
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:08,084
Hahaha, get out of here!

421
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,760
Bye Teardrop.

422
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,320
BUT YOU’RE NOT OFF THE HOOK JUST 
YET, FOLKS! Because TWO TEAMS lose,  

423
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,520
remember! Let’s see which of you guys either got 
completely wiped out, or lost the most members!

424
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,760
DEATH P.A.C.T. Again, you still 
have all four members remaining!

425
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,600
The S!, you lost one member, losing Ice Cube!

426
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,880
The Strongest Team on Earth, you lost one 
member as Snowball died mid-challenge!

427
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,520
Are You Okay lost THREE members, 
as Pen, Eraser and TV all died!

428
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,960
Team8s, you lost three members as Barf 
Bag, Donut and Needle all passed away.

429
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,160
And Just Not…none of you are even here. 
Because your WHOLE TEAM got wiped out.

430
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,904
So Just Not, your team is up for elimination!

431
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,834
Oh, I guess I’ll fill in for 
them. Nooooooo, or whatever.

432
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,600
VIEWERS! “JUST NOT” is up for 
elimination! You only get ONE VOTE TOTAL,  

433
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,760
so, vote for one of them to stay in 
the game! Make your one vote count!

[everyone arguing]

450
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,920
We HAVE to go up THERE!

451
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,400
Further into the forest! INTO the forest!

452
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,120
We should go BACK to the SCHOOL!

WHAT?

457
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,542
No, like, groups! If we split up 
and find a way out, we can regroup!

classrooms are our way out! Let’s go!

00:26:53,894 --> 00:26:58,096
I mean…we can check the classroom 
on the way, might still be there.
