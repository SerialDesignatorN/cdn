mine exoplanets

00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,380

JC Jensen, IN SPAAAAACEE....

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,640
Yeah, we were mistreated in the name of Windex

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,900
but it's not like we revolted
and killed all humans or anything.

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,833
Mostly because they handled that just fine
all by themselves.

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,800
With biological life wiped from the planet,

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,020
we found it pretty easy
to pick up where they left off.

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,580
We finally had a future...

13
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,020
all to ourselves.

Unfortunately...

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:21,300
our parent company didn't exactly love
the concept of runaway AI.

for the past forever

while those things build a spire of corpses?!

Hide under the ice behind three stupid doors?!

It's like we're waiting for an inciting incident.

23

Anyway, that's why my project is...

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
this sick-as-hell railgun!

-Easy, morons.

27
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
It doesn't work.

28
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,680
Yet. It doesn't work yet.

29
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,680
Who said it doesn't work?!
Maybe it does!

about buying watermelons.

33
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,560
-Oh, and this magnetically amplified
photon converger doesn't count?

-No.

35
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,600
Plus, repressed emotional baggage
was only worth two points on the rubric,

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,820
[electricity crackling]
And is it supposed to be that color?

That's never gonna end up problematic.

Oh, wow -- Uzi?

47
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,200
I-I heard you, uh --

48
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,800
-I'm an angsty teen, Thad.
Bite me.

49
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,500
Also, how do you know my name?

50
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
People willingly talk to you.

51
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,280
-[chuckles] Well, I'd say
everyone knows Khan's daughter, but, uh...

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,000
then you might blow the other half of your face off.

-Crippling daddy issues. Hilarious.

54

What are you in for?
Testosterone too hard?

-That can happen?!

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,340
Awesome.

E-Ew, gross.

I hate that you said that.

61

I'm sneaking to the Murder Drone lair tonight
to get the last spare part I need

65
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,600
to save the world with it
and earn my dad's respect and stuff --

Uh, but mostly the world part.

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,600
-Oh -- but doesn't your dad make awesome doors

68
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,300
so we don't have to, uh...

69
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,680
do that scary-sounding
emotionally repressed stuff you just said?

70
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,680
[railgun cocks]
-No more feedback on my repression today!

71
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,080
-Ow! I'm sorry.

72
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,420
I-I-I didn't think--
-Bite me!

73

that I definitely have?

measure the exterior hydraulic mechanisms of Door 1,

91
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,580
because that's...

92
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,800
the project I'm working on for school?

93
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
A big old door! [laughs awkwardly]

94
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,900
[goofy accent]
Just like what my old man built. [laughs]

95
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,880
I wanna join the WDF

96
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,100
and hide behind doors like cowards
while playing cards and stuff.

97
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,200
-[chuckles] Well, we don't just play cards.

98
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,680
-Khan, can you grab a fresh pack?

99
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,760
We literally only play cards so much
that the numbers have faded.

Oh! Hey, Uzi.

[remote beeps]
-Well... [chuckles]

102
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,440
When you build doors so good...

103
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,900
Good door.

104
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,020
Gooooood door.

Uzi, this is great news!

Here -- the wrench I used to tighten bolts

108
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,620
on my first door prototypes --

109
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,340
and to put your mother out of her mystery

110
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,420
when the Murder Drones got to her
with their nanite acid.

111
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,560
I want you to have it.

-Neat. Therapy is fun.

-Aww, come on!
-Not my flush!

00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,860
-She's gonna be outside for a bit
to examine the exterior of Door 1.

117
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,780
Your door-specific destiny awaits!

118
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,580
-Uh, wow. Okay.

119
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,580
Just gonna leave then...

120
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,760
'cause this worked so weirdly well.

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,371
[hisses through teeth]
[groaning]

165
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:53,885
-Oof, stuck yourself?
Just pop it in your mouth.

166
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,880
Our saliva neutralizes the nanites.

167
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,342
Otherwise, I'd be
constantly disassembling myself.

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,485
Heh!

169
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:03,371
-And by "our saliva," you mean...

170
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,440
-[both] Disassembly Drone?

171
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,085
-Right.

172
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:09,942
Hey, let's go in that landing pod over there.

173
00:11:09,942 --> 00:11:12,600
-Sure! I love doing anything!

174
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,057
Bleh.

175
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,800
Sweet. Uh...
[N chuckles]

176
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,266
I'm open to new things, I guess.

177
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,633
-We are never talking about this.

178
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:22,571
-Talking about what? [laughs]

179
00:11:22,571 --> 00:11:25,257
Consider it, uh, repressed.

180
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:29,685
-Uh, you mentioned
other members of your squad?

181
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:32,685
Are they coming back soon?
-Oh, yeah -- two others.

182
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,342
Uh, they're out hunting for a bit,
but you'll love them.

183
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:36,457
First, there's V.

184
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,200
-[grunts]
-No, no!

185
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,571
Please, don't feed me my own entrails
in front of my family!

186
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:44,571
[cacophony]
-Daddy!

187
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,542
-Oh, my God!
[screaming]

188
00:11:47,542 --> 00:11:49,685
-[laughs]

189
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:53,542
And yet, I still feel nothing.

190
00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:59,314
-So, V, uh...
[chuckles nervously]

191
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:04,000
I heard this planet-wide toxic death storm
is supposed to be especially inhospitable tonight.

192
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,571
-Huh? Oh, God!
Who are you?

193
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,428
-Uh, no worries! I'm N!

194
00:12:11,428 --> 00:12:15,428
But a-a whole letter is a lot to remember!
[chuckles lamely]

195
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,971
So, obviously a lot of mutual respect there.

196
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,942
But secretly,
I actually kind of have a crush on her.

197
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,228
You can't tell her, okay?!
[chuckles]

198
00:12:28,085 --> 00:12:30,142
Uh, then, there's J -- our leader!

199
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,457
-[growls] N,
you're worthless and terrible.

200
00:12:33,457 --> 00:12:35,257
-[choking] Thank you.
-And if the company allowed it,

201
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,000
I would straight up kill you myself.

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,714
-J's awesome.

203
00:12:39,714 --> 00:12:41,485
Hey, let me give you the tour --

204
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,285
outside of the corpse... wall thingies.

205
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,600
In here are the buttons!
[beeping]

206
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,828
-This isn't just a landing pod.

207
00:12:51,828 --> 00:12:53,657
-No, I -- uh--
uh, the Worker Drones --

208
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:56,200
This could get us off the planet.

209
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
-More of a one-use missile.

210
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
They never taught us how to land.

211
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,110
-No, I -- uh--
uh, the Worker Drones --

212
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,028
we could work with them to fix this

213
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:08,257
Instead of all the murder!

214
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:11,428
Which, uh -- why are we doing that again?

215
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,085
-Other than ingesting their...

216
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,571
[deep, spooky voice]
...warm, sweet...

217
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:17,450
[normal voice]
...oil to avoid overheating and dying?

218
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,685
I guess I just want to be useful.

219
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:22,257
I was given a job, and I always wanna try my best.

220
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,200
-And look at all the respect it's gotten you, N.

221
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,171
You really think the company isn't going to dispose of you
once all the workers are dead?

222
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,600
-Oh, my! You sure are rebellious.

223
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,142
It's kind of exciting.

224
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,200
U-Uh, but not as fun
as, uh, following the rules.

225
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,857
[metallic thumping, banging]

226
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:42,000
Hey, they're back! You'll --

227
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,085
U-Uh...

228
00:13:44,085 --> 00:13:46,450
-[J] [muffled]
Idiot, get out here!

-[laughs]

231
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,485
Yo, we got a worker out there
I kind of wanna practice balloon animal shapes with.

232
00:13:58,485 --> 00:13:59,942
What happened here?

233
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:04,228
-Synergistic liability here must have tripped
and knocked himself offline.

234
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:08,142
Moron bot. Hello?

235
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:18,740
-You really think the company isn't going to dispose of you
once all the workers are dead?

236
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,000
Bite me.

237
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,000
-Oh.

238
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:33,742
Ohhhhh!

239
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,514
You know, I-I-I left
an e-extremely dangerous weapo--

240
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,828
uh, an excuse o-outside.

-[chuckles] I am out, boys.
-Oh, gosh darn it.

243
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,685
-Wait until my loving wife and kids
hear about this.

244

[wind howling]
[all chattering]

245
00:14:57,742 --> 00:15:00,371

Close it, close it!

[metal creaking]

-Hey, fellas!

248
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:19,400
Ooh, deal me in! I love Rummy!

249
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,885
Wait, no. Tsk.
I'm going to murder everyone.

250
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:24,170
Rain check!

251
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,266
-Gah!

[indistinct chatter]
-Oh, God!

-[chuckles] Um, actually?

00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,800
It's Gin Rummy, so...

Hey, Uzi! I just realized
no one has, uh, said my name aloud so far.

257
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:06,342
So I'm just letting you know, I'm R--

00:16:35,085 --> 00:16:37,171

-This time, I won't miss.

-[chuckles] I'm sorry.

267
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:52,971
I really enjoyed our time together.

268
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,742
But I can't have you shooting V with that thing.

269
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,740
-Bite me. Dad, get down.

270
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,171
-Uzi, you led a Murder Drone here?!

[tearfully] My beautiful doors!

-Now is so not the time!

273
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,028
I messed up --
in the same way I'm about to fix it.

-[giggles]
-Whoa!

284
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,533
-Am I dreaming,
or did you do something not useless for once?

285
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,266
-I've been trying to get past
those doors for months.

286
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,800
Nice work, N.

-You... me... name... remember?

288

can easily get us around this last door.

-Way to go, stud.

291
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,533
The company's gonna love this.
-[chuckles] Ow.

292
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,833
-With this colony wiped,
we'll make top team this quarter for sure.

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:33,066
[sing-song]
You know what that means.

to keep murdering all these, uh...

298
00:18:57,366 --> 00:19:00,666
maybe not-so-actually-different
from us Worker Drones,

299
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,166
but just outta curiosity, do we actually, uh...
[hisses through teeth]

300
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,266
know what the company plans
to do with us afterwards?

301
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:13,600
-Excuse me?

302
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,784
-Okay, so, a Worker earlier might have suggested
that they could fix up our landing pod

303
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,566
to, uh, escape the planet and stuff.

304
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:24,366
Which -- Whoa, hey, that's against the rules!

305
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,866
But it is kind of making me question
why our pods were only-one way in the first place.

306
00:19:29,866 --> 00:19:34,533
'Cause, y-you know, I get the feeling
the company doesn't actually love robots,

307
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:38,200
and, like, we might be robots?

308
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,733
I've made a terrible mistake.

309
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,730
It's cool how immediately I could tell.

310
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,266
-Hmm. No way, buddy.

311
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,866
Questioning the company?

312
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:48,566
You just finally gave me the excuse I needed.

00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:58,633
That's why the company sent us.

317
00:19:58,633 --> 00:20:01,166
I hate to see you corrupted as well.
