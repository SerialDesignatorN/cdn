-Welcome to the Amazing Digital Circus!

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,293
My name is Caine!

5
00:00:17,293 --> 00:00:19,333
I'm your ringmaster,
and I'm here to show you

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:22,600
the most jaw-dropping, heart-stopping,
mind-bending paraphernalia

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,440
you've ever laid your eyes upon!

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,680
Isn't that right, Bubble?
-That's right, Caine!

9
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,000
I can't wait to see
what you've got cooking up for today.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,560
-Well, let's not waste any time.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,960
Let's get right into the show.

ðŸŽµ Past the moon and the sun
and we don't know why ðŸŽµ

00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:13,328
-Caine, is this one of your NPCs,
or is this a new sucker?

22
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:14,912
'Cause if it's a new character,

23
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:17,792
we're gonna have to redo
this whole theme song.

24
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:20,416
[Zooble]: I'm not doing that again.
-My, my!

25
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:23,584
It appears a new human has entered this realm!

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,192
-How do I... take this...

28
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:29,056
-Just keep grabbing at it.

29
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,784
That worked for all of us.

31
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:37,936
W-What's going on?

32
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,656
I-I-I put on some weird headset,

33
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,380
and now I'm...

34
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,460
here.

35
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,320
Who are you people?

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,600
Why can't I take it off?
Where am I?

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,280
-Let's just try to calm down.

38
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,560
Everything's gonna be okay, new stuff.

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,720
We've all been through this.
You just need to get your head to--

-What the [boing!] is going on?!

41
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,980
Wha--
-Now, now, now, my dear.

42
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,160
We can't have any of that
foul language around here.

The Amazing Digital Circus is a place
to be enjoyed by all ages.

44
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,900
You, my friend, stumbled into

U-Uh, well, h-how do I...

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,060
you know, leave?

00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,380
-Uh--

-W-Well, don't freak out about it or anything,

55
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,740
but, uh, we don't exactly...

56

-You can't.
-What?

57
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,760
[Zooble]: Shut up, Jax.

58
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
But, yeah, he's right.

59
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,560
Welcome to your new home.

00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,540
What do you mean?

63
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,920
-Guys, don't be mean.

64
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,600
-We've been stuck here for years.

65

Old Kinger over there's
supposedly been here the longest.

66

[Kinger]: Huh? Did someone say something
about an insect collection?

67
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,940
-That's why he's crazy.

68
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,440

This is a dream,

72
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,500
and I should just play along
until I wake up, right?

73
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,340
-Whatever you say, kid.

a tour of the circus grounds first.

-Uh--
-Off we go!

Here, we have...

81

This is where your living quarters are,

82
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,977
as well as all sorts of other activities!

83
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,400
These activities may include...

84
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,440
[dial-up tone blares]

85
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,310
...Ball pits, mini golf, and more!

86
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,320
And here, we have...

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,820
Drown yourself in the digital lake

88
00:03:53,822 --> 00:03:57,222
or engage in ridery at the digital carnival!

-Of course not.

93
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:07,466
This is THE VOID!

94
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,200
We don't venture out into the void.

95
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
[spooky voice]
Not even I know what's out there.

96
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,266
-That's, uh--
-We stay right here, where I can keep my...

97
00:04:16,266 --> 00:04:19,800
[dramatic voice]
...hundreds of all-seeing eyes on you.

-[soft voice]
Hello, Caine. I love you.

-Eaugh! Let's get outta here
before the moon gets frisky.

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,133
-Wait, what's that--

101

Blegh!

-Whoa, clean up on aisle you!

[slurping]

00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:41,200
-Why are you like this?

106
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,333
-[groans] Wait, wait!

107
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,466
W-Was that an exit door I saw out there?

108
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,777
Is that a way to leave?
-What exit?

109
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:52,311
If there was a way to leave, 
I'm pretty sure we'd have all left by now.

110
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,111
[gagging]
[Zooble]: Yeah, what are you talking about?

111
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,844
-U-Uh, I -- [clears throat]

112
00:04:57,844 --> 00:05:01,444
I assure you,
there is no "magical exit door."

113
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,911
You're probably just experiencing...

114
00:05:04,777 --> 00:05:07,511
From your mind's transition to the digital plane.

115
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,644
-But, I-I swear, I saw --
-[frantic] Digital hallucinations!

116
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:16,688
How about we talk about something else?

117
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,888
Like your name!
-My name?

118
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:21,355
My name is, uh...

119
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:23,955
U-U-Uh?! Oh, God!

120
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:25,866
Why can't I remember my name?!

121
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,222
-Nobody can remember their name
once they enter the Digital Circus.

122
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,355
One of the few things I don't have control over are your minds.

123
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:35,955
So, all I can help you with
is coming up with a new one.

124
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,688
-[groaning] What's my name?

125
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:42,022
-Don't you worry your little head.

126
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:44,422
Your new name can be anything!

127
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,622
Hereby acknowledging that your chosen name and or names
may not breach the Digital Circus user license agreement

stating that your name may not include objectionable content.

129
00:05:47,822 --> 00:05:49,555
Objectionable content includes but is not limited
to sexually explicit materials,

130
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:52,022
obscene, defamatory, libelous,
slanderous, violent, and/or unlawful content or profanity.

131
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:54,155
What are ya thinkin'?
-Huh?

132
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:56,155
I don't care.
Just pick anything.

133
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,622
-Let's see!

134
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,955
[wheel dinging]

135
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:03,422
What do you think of...
[stammers phonetic sounds]

136
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,755
-I don't--
-You're right, terrible. Let's try that again.

137
00:06:07,755 --> 00:06:09,688
What do you think of "Pomni"?

138
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:12,022
-Huh? Uh, s-sure.

139
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:14,555
I think I just-
-Gadzooks, you're right, Jax!

140
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,155
We should have a brand new adventure
for our new member, Pomni!

141
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:19,755
-I said that like five minutes ago.

142
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,488
-You! Do you like adventure?

143
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,822
Activity? Wonder? Danger?
Horror? Pain? Suffering? Agony?

144
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:25,220
Death? Disease? Death? 
Angel food cake?

145
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,220
-[chomp!]

146
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,866
-You parasite!

147
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,220
-Uh, I don't really...

148
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,860
-Since you're new around here,
we're gonna make it a simple in-house adventure

149
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,377
to warm you up
to how things work around here.

150
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,111
[Zooble]: Wha-- No! God!

151
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,377
I don't want an in-house adventure.

152
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,800
-Don't worry, Zooble.

153
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,644
I'll make it something unobtrusive
that you can still choose to not get involved with.

154
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,040
Today's adventure is...

155
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:52,688
[cackling maniacally]

156
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:55,222
That's right!

157
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,377
The entire circus tent
will be infested with gloinks,

158
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,177
and you gotta catch 'em all.

159
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,844
-But what are they?
-I'm glad you asked, Bubble.

160
00:07:02,844 --> 00:07:05,244
They're small --
-And what do they do?

161
00:07:05,244 --> 00:07:06,311
-They --
-And how do they --

162
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,310
-Gloinks are small mischievous critters

163
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,844
that steal anything
 and everything they run into.

164
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,240
Why do these humanoid hash browns do this?

165
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,380
How do you stop them?

166
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,355
That's for you to find out.

167
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,380
Now, good luck.

168
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,840
And have fun, my little superstars!

169
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,460
-What did any of that mean?

170
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:29,200
-Oh, that's just one of Caine's
little adventures.

171
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,266
They're just something fun to do
to, you know...

172
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,000
prevent us from going insane.
[chuckles nervously]

173
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,733
[Zooble]: [sighs] Speak for yourself.

174
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,600
If anyone needs me, then [sproing!] off.

175
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,460
Oh, God! Oh, jeez! No!

176
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,400
[gloinks boinging, squeaking]

177
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,200
Oh, God! Agh!

178
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,066
Somebody help!

179
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,330
-[bored] Oh, no, they killed Zooble.

180
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,330
Anyway, you guys wanna go
get something to eat?

181
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,666
-Oh, wait -- we should go check on Kaufmo.

182
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,533
I'm pretty sure he'd like to meet Pomni.

183
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,466
[Kinger]: My impenetrable fortress!

184
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,266
-You wanna come with us to check on Kaufmo?

185
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:05,533
[Kinger]: No, not really.

186
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,533
I think Kaufmo's gone insane.

187
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,133
Last time I spoke with him,
he was rambling endlessly about some exit.

188
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,533
Kind of like you, Pomni.

189
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,530
You might be going insane, too.

190
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:21,244
-But, wait -- wouldn't that more likely mean
the exit does exist?

191
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,888
-Could also mean you just have
a jump-start on losing your mind.

192
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,288
-[quietly] Wait, what about Zooble?

193
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:28,622
-Well, I think I'd like to ask him about it --

194
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,288
U-Uh, if this was real.

195
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:34,488
Which it isn't, because it's a dream.

196
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:37,222
-Heh, she still thinks this is a dream.

197
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:41,155
-U-Uh, why are you looking at me like that?

198
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:45,066
-I'm fine with doing whatever, as long as
I get to see funny things happen to people.

199
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,266
Ow! Okay, I've already had
enough of these things.

200
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,333
[sighs] You, me, and Pomni
will go check on Kaufmo,

201
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,600
which leaves Crybaby and Hoo-ha together

202
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
to go handle the Zooble situation.

203
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,644
-[laughs nervously] Do you think
pairing them up together is a good idea?

204
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,911
-Of course I do.

205
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:07,577
They're the two most mentally stable
and capable characters to be paired together.

206
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,422
Come on, ladies --
let's go harass the clown.

207
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,022
-My comedy mask is broken again.

208
00:09:19,355 --> 00:09:20,622
[Kinger]: Gah! Oh!

209
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,022
Gangle, you startled me.

210
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,355
-So, this is where we all live --

211
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,355
or, well, where we all sleep at night.

212
00:09:27,355 --> 00:09:29,200
Even though we don't really need to sleep,

213
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,800
it's sometimes nice
to kind of take a break from everything

214
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
and have a bit of a routine, you know?

215
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
I'm sure there'll be one for...

216
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,266
Oh, look -- you already got one.

217
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,222
-I still don't understand about the adventures.

218
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:46,222
Why even go on them at all?

219
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:50,088
W-W-Why not try to find a way to leave?

220
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:53,555
-Well, we usually do -- when we first arrive.

221
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:58,066
But after a while, you start to realize
that you really can't leave

222
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,777
and constantly chasing an unattainable goal
will start driving you a bit crazy.

223
00:10:01,777 --> 00:10:04,377
And eventually, you get to asking
what the point of anything is,

224
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,377
and you completely lose sight of who you are
and why you're even alive.

225
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:11,377
And when you reach your breaking point,
something really terrible can happen.

226
00:10:14,644 --> 00:10:18,177
Ah, but that's not something we need to deal with today.

227
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,600
Above anything else,
the adventures give us something to do

228
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,780
that keeps our minds healthy and stimulated.
[doorbell rings]

229
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,600
-Thank goodness this is all a dream, right, Pomni?

230
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:29,260
[unsettling musical sting]

231
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:35,130
-[gasps] Why are we here again?

232
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,333
What are we doing?
-We're getting one of our friends.

233
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,200
[doorbell rings]

234
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:46,355
Huh. Maybe he's not in his room?

235
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,955
I hope he's all right.
-Don't worry, dollface.

236
00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:50,755
I've got a key to his room.

237
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,422
-Wha-- Wait, wh-- why?

238
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:54,866
You -- You -- You shouldn't have keys
to anyone's room.

239
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:58,133
-Nah, I've got keys everywhere,
and you've all been fine.

240
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,100
By the way, I may have left something
in your room today,

241
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,330
so let me know if you find it.

242
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,400
Uh, you're not afraid of centipedes, are you?

243
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,933
-Jax! That's literally my only fear!
Why would you do this?!

244
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:10,733
-What? It could be
a completely unrelated question.

245
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:12,333
You'll never know until it's too late.

249
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,666
Thanks for keeping an eye on it, Kaufy.

250
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,511
I'm gonna head out. See ya.

251
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:28,460
-[nervously] Oh! Kaufmo's been abstracted!

252
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:29,866
That -- That's okay.

253
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,311
-What... is that?
-[Kaufo growls]

254
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,111
-Uh, it might be that terrible thing
I was talking about earlier

255
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,844
when you reach your breaking point.

256
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,377
-H-huh?
-O-Okay, wait.

257
00:11:40,377 --> 00:11:43,244
M-Maybe there's still time to fix him if we get Caine.

-[gasps]
-Oh, whoa!

259
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,711
Kaufmo, listen -- I know we didn't
always get along,

260
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:50,577
like when you called me out
for fake-laughing at your jokes.

261
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:54,511
I swear, I really did think they were funny.
I was just having a bit of a bad day!s

Do you think... you could...

266
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,244
perhaps help me out here?

267
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,022
I understand... if you don't... want to, though.

Thank you for the recap.
